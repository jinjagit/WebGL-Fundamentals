# WebGL-Fundamentals

Working through the [WebGL Fundamental course](https://webglfundamentals.org/)  

## setup

You'll need node js and php (for server) installed.  

I'm running on Linux, so all instructions are for that context.  

## running the examples

To run each example: Navigate to folder and run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080` to serve `index.html` locally @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (preferable), or just double-click on `index.html` (if you haven't got php installed).

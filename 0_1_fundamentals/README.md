# 0.1 [Fundamentals - fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fundamentals.html)  

A very basic template that draws a single pink triangle on a full-page canvas.

My variations from example code:
* Canvas is resized to be the largest square that can fit on the page. This is not necessarily ideal and will change perspective of image(s) relative to examples. Adjust to taste.  
* Canvas has grey background, body has black background. 
* Scroll-bars are disabled.
